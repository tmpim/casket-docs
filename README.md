# casket-docs

This repository contains the documentation for [Casket](https://github.com/tmpim/casket), a fork of [mholt's Caddy web
server](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) v1. This documentation is forked from the Caddy v1 docs as of June 2020,
converted from HTML to Markdown in [this
commit](https://github.com/tmpim/casket-docs/commit/2ac4b866cad687f52a94d262ee2687a5b4e60acd), and then updated to
reflect the changes in Casket.

For more information on what Casket is, see the [Casket repository](https://github.com/tmpim/casket), or the [Casket
documentation](https://docs.casketserver.com/).
