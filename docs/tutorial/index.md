# Quick Start

1.  [Download Casket](https://github.com/tmpim/casket/releases) and put it in your PATH.

2.  `cd` to your website's directory.

3.  Run `casketfile`.

Done! Open your browser to <http://localhost:2015> to see it working. Casket serves the current working directory by
default.

If you see a 404 error, then Casket is working but the root of your site is missing an index file. (Need more guidance?
Read the [beginner tutorial](/tutorial/beginner).)

Next, [learn to configure Casket using the Casketfile](/tutorial/casketfile).
