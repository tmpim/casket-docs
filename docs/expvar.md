# http.expvar

expvar exposes variables about the runtime or current process state in JSON format. The default endpoint is /debug/vars.
By default, it reports memory statistics, the command used to run Caddy, and the number of goroutines.

::: warning
This is a debugging tool. Although it is usually safe to use this on live sites, take care that you do not reveal
anything sensitive. Also note that plugins may add to the list of values that are published.
