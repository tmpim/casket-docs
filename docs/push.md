# http.push

push enables and configures HTTP/2 server push.

Server push can accelerate page loads by sending resources that the server knows the client will need, but has not yet
asked for. It is *not* a replacement for WebSockets. It must also be configured carefully, especially with regards for
client-side caching, or pushing can actually decrease performance. If a client caches a resource after the first time it
is pushed, subsequent pushes of the same resource are unnecessary.

Casket knows which resources to push either from rules you provide in the Casketfile or from [Link
headers](https://w3c.github.io/preload/#server-push-http-2) coming from some upstream.

## Syntax

``` casketfile
push
```

Enables server push for any request by reading the Link HTTP header of the response. Useful if you're proxying to a
backend app with [proxy](/proxy) or [fastcgi](/fastcgi), for example, that sets the Link headers for preload purposes.

To configure a basic push rule:

``` casketfile
push path [resources...]
```

-   **path** is the base path of requests which to apply this rule.
-   **resources...** is a space-separated list of resources to push. If no resources are specified, then only Link
    headers will be used to know push assets.

To push many resources that won't fit on a single line or to change the method or headers of the synthetic request used
to initiate the pushes, open a block:

``` casketfile
push path [resources...] {
    method method
    header name value
    resources
}
```

-   **path** and **resources** are the same as above, except when specifying resources inside the block, only list one
    resource per line.
-   **method** specifies the method for the synthetic request that is made to initiate the push; can be GET or HEAD.
    Default is GET.
-   **header** adds a header to the synthetic request that is made to initiate the push; can be specified multiple
    times. It consists of a field name and a value. Pseudo-header fields are not allowed.

## Examples

Enable server push for all requests using Link headers:

``` casketfile
push
```

Push Google Analytics script for all requests (not cache-aware):

``` casketfile
push / /ga.js
```

Push a couple CSS files for requests to the home page:

``` casketfile
push /index.html /common.css /home.css
```

Push many resources to the home page:

``` casketfile
push /index.html {
    /resources/css/common.css
    /resources/css/home.css
    /resources/css/compiled.css
    /resources/js/main.js
    /resources/js/jquery.min.js
    /resources/images/logo.png
    /resources/images/background.jpg
}
```

Specify a method and header for all push requests:

``` casketfile
push {
    method HEAD
    header MyHeader "The value"
}
```
