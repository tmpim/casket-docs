# http.internal

internal protects all resources in the specified directory from external requests. Browsers (or any client) that
directly requests a resource in the protected directory will receive a 404 Not Found status.

Because this directive supports the X-Accel-Redirect header, it is often used in conjunction with a backend proxy.
Requests to a different URL than the internal one may be redirected to a proxy, which can set the X-Accel-Redirect
header. When Caddy sees this coming from the proxy, it will allow access to the internal resource and send it to the
client. This is also known sometimes as X-Sendfile.

This pattern handling requests allows a backend proxy to perform logging, authentication, and other things without the
client having to deal with redirects.

## Syntax

``` caddyfile
internal path
```

-   **path** is the base path to protect from external requests

## Examples

To protect all contents of /internal from being served directly:

``` caddyfile
internal /internal
```

Part of an example Caddyfile that protects some resources but allows a proxy to grant access to them (the service
listening on :9000 must set X-Accel-Redirect):

``` caddyfile
internal /internal
proxy    /redirect http://localhost:9000
```
