# http.markdown

markdown serves [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files as HTML pages on demand. You can specify
whole custom templates or just the CSS and JavaScript files to be used on the pages to give them a custom look and
behavior.

## Syntax

``` casketfile
markdown [basepath] {
    ext         extensions...
    [css|js]    file
    template    [name] path
    templatedir defaultpath
}
```

-   **basepath** is the base path to match. Markdown will not activate if the request URL is not prefixed with this
    path. Default is site root.
-   **extensions...** is a space-delimited list of file extensions to treat as Markdown (defaults to .md, .markdown, and
    .mdown); this is different from the [ext](/ext) directive which assumes a missing file extension.
-   **css** indicates that the next argument is a CSS file to use on the page.
-   **js** indicates that the next argument is a JavaScript file to include on the page.
-   **file** is the JS or CSS file to add to the page.
-   **template** defines a template with the given **name** to be at the given **path**. To specify the default
    template, omit *name*. Markdown files can choose a template by using the name in its front matter.
-   **templatedir** sets the default path with the given *defaultpath* to be used when listing templates.

You can use the js and css arguments more than once to add more files to the default template. If you want to accept
defaults, you should completely omit the curly braces.

## Front Matter (Document Metadata)

Markdown files may begin with *front matter*, which is a specially-formatted block of metadata about the file. For
example, it could describe the HTML template to use to render the file, or define the contents of the title tag. Front
matter can be in YAML, TOML, or JSON formats.

[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) front matter starts and ends with `+++`:

``` toml
+++
template = "blog"
title = "Blog Homepage"
sitename = "A Casket site"
+++
```

[YAML](http://yaml.org/) is surrounded by `---`:

``` yaml
---
template: blog
title: Blog Homepage
sitename: A Casket site
---
```

[JSON](http://json.org) is simply `{` and `}`:

``` json
{
    "template": "blog",
    "title": "Blog Homepage",
    "sitename": "A Casket site"
}
```

The front matter fields "author", "copyright", "description", and "subject" will be used to create `<meta>` tags on the
rendered pages.

## Markdown Templates

Template files are just HTML files with template tags, called actions, that can insert dynamic content depending on the
file being served. The variables defined in metadata can be accessed from the templates like 
<code v-pre>{{.Doc.variable}}</code> where 'variable' is the name of the variable. The variable `.Doc.body` holds the 
body of the markdown file.

Here is a simple example template (contrived):

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{{.Doc.title}}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Welcome to {{.Doc.sitename}}!
        <br><br>
        {{.Doc.body}}
    </body>
</html>
```

Along with these template actions, all the standard [Casket template actions](/template-actions) are available to you in
Markdown templates. Be sure to sanitize anything you render as HTML (use the `html`, `js`, and `urlquery` functions)!

## Examples

Serve Markdown pages in /blog with no special formatting (assumes .md is the Markdown extension):

``` casketfile
markdown /blog
```

Same as above, but with custom CSS and JS files:

``` casketfile
markdown /blog {
    ext .md .txt
    css /css/blog.css
    js  /js/blog.js
}
```

With custom templates:

``` casketfile
markdown /blog {
    template default.html
    template blog  blog.html
    template about about.html
}
```
