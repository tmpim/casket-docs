# http.cgi

This plugin implements the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) for Caddy. It lets you generate dynamic content on your
website by means of command line scripts. To collect information about the inbound HTTP request, your script examines
certain environment variables such as PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING. Then, to return a dynamically generated web page to
the client, your script simply writes content to standard output. In the case of POST requests, your script reads
additional inbound content from standard input.

## Examples

### Simple CGI script

``` caddyfile
In the Caddyfile:

  cgi /report /usr/local/cgi-bin/report

In /usr/local/cgi-bin/report:

  #!/bin/bash

  printf "Content-type: text/plain\n\n"

  printf "PATH_INFO    [%s]\n" $PATH_INFO
  printf "QUERY_STRING [%s]\n" $QUERY_STRING

  exit 0
```

When a request such as <https://example.com/report> or <https://example.com/report/weekly> arrives, the cgi middleware
will detect the match and invoke the script named /usr/local/cgi-bin/report. The environment variables PATH_INFO and
QUERY_STRING are populated and passed to the script automatically. There are a number of other standard CGI variables
included that are described in the documentation. If you need to pass any special environment variables or allow any
environment variables that are part of Caddy&#39;s process to pass to your script, you will need to use the advanced
directive syntax described in the documentation.
