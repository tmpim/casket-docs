# http.websocket

websocket facilitates a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets) server/proxy. A command is
executed when a new [WebSocket
connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications) is made and Caddy
relays the client's connection to the command.

Any command can be executed as long as it takes input from stdin and writes to stdout, as this is how it will
communicate with the WebSocket client. The command does not need to know that it is talking to a Web Socket client; just
use stdin and stdout.

Caddy will not make any effort to keep the backend process alive while a client is connected. It is the developer's
responsibility to ensure the program does not terminate until the client is ready to close the connection or would be
ready for it to terminate.

::: info
Note that HTTP/2 does not support protocol upgrade, so you may have to disable HTTP/2 in order to use this directive
successfully on secure connections.

## Syntax

``` caddyfile
websocket [path] command
```

-   **path** is the base path to match with the request URL
-   **command** is the command to execute

If path is omitted, a default path of / is assumed (meaning all requests).

## Examples

Simple WebSockets echo server:

``` caddyfile
websocket /echo cat
```
