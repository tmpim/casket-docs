# http.redir

redir sends the client an HTTP redirect status code if the URL matches the specified pattern. It is also possible to
make a redirect conditional.

## Syntax

``` caddyfile
redir from to [code]
```

-   **from** is the request path to match (it must match exactly, except for `/`, which is a catch-all).
-   **to** is the path to redirect to (may use [request placeholders](/placeholders)).
-   **code** is the HTTP status code to respond with; must be in the range \[300-308\] excluding 306. May also be `meta`
    to issue meta tag redirect for browsers. The default status code is 301 Moved Permanently.

To create a permanent, "catch-all" redirect, omit the *from* value:

``` caddyfile
redir to
```

If you have a lot of redirects, share a redirect code by making a table:

``` caddyfile
redir [code] {
    from to [code]
}
```

Each line defines a redirect and may optionally overwrite the redirect code defined at the top of the table. If no
redirect code is specified, the default is used.

A group of redirects can also be conditional:

``` caddyfile
redir [code] {
    if    a cond b
    if_op [and|or]
    ...
}
```

-   **if** specifies a rewrite condition. Multiple ifs are AND-ed together by default. **a** and **b** are any string
    and may use [request placeholders](/placeholders). **cond** is the condition, with possible values explained in
    [rewrite](/rewrite#if) (which also has an `if` statement).
-   **if_op** specifies how the ifs are evaluated; the default is `and`.

## Preserving Path

By default, redirects are from precisely matching paths to the precise location you've defined. You can preserve the
path or other portions of the request URL by using [replaceable values](/placeholders), such as {uri} or {path}, in any
"to" argument. Only request placeholders are supported.

## Examples

When a request comes in for `/resources/images/photo.jpg`, redirect to `/resources/images/drawing.jpg` with HTTP 307
(Temporary Redirect) status code:

``` caddyfile
redir /resources/images/photo.jpg /resources/images/drawing.jpg 307
```

Redirect all requests to https://newsite.com while preserving the request URI:

``` caddyfile
redir https://newsite.com{uri}
```

Defining multiple redirections that share a 307 status code, except the last one:

``` caddyfile
redir 307 {
    /foo     /info/foo
    /todo    /notes
    /api-dev /api       meta
}
```

Redirect only if the forwarded protocol is HTTP:

``` caddyfile
redir 301 {
    if {>X-Forwarded-Proto} is http
    /  https://{host}{uri}
}
```
